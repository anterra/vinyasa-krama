    "What follows is my development of the proof-of-concept prototype for an app called Vinyasa Krama, an app which generates complete, well-structured, safe and compelling yoga sequences, via a bi-directional LSTM. In this app, the user is able to pick a desired 'peak' pose -- this is generally the most difficult posture located in the middle of a yoga class, and a custom class will be generated for them which will proper warm them up for and cool them down from that pose, properly preparing the relevant muslces and joints. The class is hence generated from the middle out. They can then take the class, and follow along with an animated yoga teacher (created in the Unity game engine) who will demonstrate the class pose by pose. "

It is an intermedate posture which involved leg strength, hamstring flexibility, and core strength. \n",

    "* Good at repeating poses when they are imbalanced (one sided)\n",

    "* Improved consistency of output. There's too much variability right now with it sometimes giving less good sequences with really random poses showing up in orders they shouldn't. \n",
